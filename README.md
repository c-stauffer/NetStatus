# NetStatus
small program that sends pings at intervals and logs failures -- for troubleshooting spotty ISP performance

Whipped up a little utility to see when my internet drops out. I may pick away at adding new features like customizing ping size and interval and stuff like that, but for now I'm just logging to send to Comcast to get them to fix their shit.
